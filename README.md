Techniques Used: Dimensionality Reduction, Geospatial Mapping, Preprocessing Pipeline.
College Scorecard Dataset Project
Overview

This project analyzes the College Scorecard dataset, which provides information on U.S. higher education institutions, including tuition, graduation rates, enrollment, and endowments. The dataset's diverse features allow for comprehensive analyses, including dimensionality reduction, geospatial mapping, and interactive visualizations.

Key Features

    Dimensionality Reduction: Visualized t-SNE results in 3D to explore relationships between institutions.
    Geospatial Mapping: Interactive Folium map showing college locations and graduation rates.
    Preprocessing Pipeline: Cleaned, standardized, and encoded data for accurate analysis.

Use Cases

    College Selection: Identify affordable colleges with high graduation rates.
    Policy Insights: Analyze regional disparities in educational outcomes.
    Geospatial Analysis: Visualize performance metrics across the U.S.
